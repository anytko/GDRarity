Description: GDRarity outlines the global model of discretized rarity and its various restrictions. By integrating geographic, functional trait-based, and phylogenetic dimensions of rarity across regional and local spatial scales, GDRarity characterizes 57 restrictionary frameworks drawn from a global model - some of which include the widely used Rabinowitz rarity, functional rarity, and eco-evolutionary rarity.
