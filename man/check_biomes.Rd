\title{Analyze Species Convex Hulls Against Biome Data}
\usage{
check_biomes(convex_hulls, biome_sf = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{convex_hulls}{A named list of convex hulls for each species.
Each element should be a list of \code{sf} polygon objects representing the convex hulls of a species' distribution.}

\item{biome_sf}{Optional \code{sf} object representing biome polygons.
If not provided, the default biome shapefile (\code{biomes.shp}) included in the package will be used. Custom biome data must include a column named \code{"BIOME"}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with \code{species_name} and one column per biome.
Values are \code{1} if the species' convex hull intersects the biome, \code{0} otherwise.
}
\description{
Checks which biomes are intersected by the convex hulls of species distributions.
By default, uses a preloaded biome shapefile containing four biomes:
Humid Tropics, Dry Tropics, Temperate, and Boreal.
Users can optionally supply their own biome shapefile as an \code{sf} object.
}
\details{
The function ensures that both the biome data and species convex hulls
are in the EPSG:4326 (WGS84) coordinate reference system. If CRS is missing,
it is assigned automatically. Polygons are validated with \code{st_make_valid()} before intersection checks.
Returns a dataframe where each row corresponds to a species, and each biome column contains \code{1} if an intersection occurs, otherwise \code{0}.
}
\note{
Custom biome data must have a \code{"BIOME"} column with biome names.

\examples{
# Example: Checking biome intersections for two Abies species
test_data <- data.frame(species_name = c("Abies_cephalonica", "Abies_firma"))
convex_hulls_abies <- get_range_convex_hulls(test_data)
abies_biomes <- check_biomes(convex_hulls_abies)
print(abies_biomes)
