\item{remove_outliers}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, removes outliers based on a specified threshold. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{outlier_threshold}{Numeric. The number of standard deviations from the mean to classify a value as an outlier. Default is \code{3}.}

\item{author_info}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, it includes authorship and contact information for data collection. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the cleaned trait data with columns: \code{scrubbed_species_binomial} and one column per requested trait. Optional columns include: \code{project_pi} and \code{project_pi_contacts}.
}
\description{
Fetches trait data for a given plant species from the BIEN database, cleans it, and merges multiple traits into a single dataframe.
}
\details{
BIEN pulls from a wide variety of trait databases, making it more likely to include information on a broader range of species compared to region-specific databases. For example, the LEDA trait database (Northwestern European specific) has both SLA and seed mass data for 8 total species beloning to the Acer and Pinus genera; the BIEN trait database has SLA and seed mass data for 27 species beloning to the same genera.
